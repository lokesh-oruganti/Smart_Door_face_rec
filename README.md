# Smart_Door_face_rec
this is a partial part of the iot project and i uploaded the main code which we used to deploy and detect the faces of user and opens the door
first using the face_rec.py train the model using a predefined images if user and assign names to each image
once the model is trained we can use the wecam.py to capture the image through camera sensor and verify the user
if the user is authorized, wecam code pushes 1 to thingspeak and the the door opens
OPEN SESEMAE!!!
